# Sorting-Visualiser
This is a web application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. You can observe how different algorithms manipulate and rearrange elements in real time, providing a visual representation of the sorting process.
## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: The application supports several popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. You can choose any algorithm and observe its execution step-by-step.

- **Random Array Generation**: The application generates random arrays of various sizes to demonstrate the sorting algorithms. The size of the array can be adjusted, allowing you to observe the behavior of the sorting algorithms with different input sizes.

- **Speed Control**: You can control the speed at which the sorting algorithms execute. The speed slider enables you to adjust the delay between each step of the sorting process, providing a clear visualization of the algorithm's operations.

- **Color-coded Visualization**: The application utilizes color-coded bars to represent the sorted elements. The height of the bars corresponds to the magnitude of the elements, while different colors help distinguish between sorted and unsorted elements.

- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to be responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. You can enjoy the sorting visualizations and explore the algorithms regardless of the device you're using.
